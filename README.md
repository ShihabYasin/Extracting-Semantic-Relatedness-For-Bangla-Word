## Abstract:				 

A framework for extracting semantic relational words in Bangla is presented in this paper. Here extraction of Synonyms, Antonyms, Hyponym, Hypernym, Meronym, Holonym and Polysemy are primarily investigated as a rule based model. For every word two other things: concept and parts of speech category are also presented for clarification. A semantic analyzer is used to extract these relations from nouns, adjectives and verbs.
