## Abstract:				 

A framework for extracting semantic relational words in Bangla is presented in this paper. Here extraction of Synonyms, Antonyms, Hyponym, Hypernym, Meronym, Holonym and Polysemy are primarily investigated as a rule based model. For every word two other things: concept and parts of speech category are also presented for clarification. A semantic analyzer is used to extract these relations from nouns, adjectives and verbs.	

## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a growing field of interest for researchers of computer science, artificial intelligence, linguistics and human computer interaction [1]. Semantic relations are unidirectional underlying connections between concepts because it studies meaning of a language. Language processing consists of morphological, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic analysis steps where semantic relatedness is important. Among two types of semantic approaches ‘Compositional Semantics’ deals with the meaning of individual units. Then it helps forming larger units. On the other hand ‘Lexical Semantics’ identify and represent semantics of each lexical item. This helps to understand meaning of larger units. Semantic relatedness has many important applications in inference, reasoning, Question Answering, Information Extraction, Machine Translation and other NLP applications. Actually semantic relations work like building blocks for creating a semantic structure of a sentence.
